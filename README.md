*How to Drive a Car* is a website that gives the user an introductory tour of how to drive a car. The inspiration for the website comes from the artistâ€™s anxiety when first learning how to drive, as the many components of the car can be intimidating for novice drivers. The informal language and cartoon-styled illustrations make the tutorial more approachable to new drivers of younger age. By creating the tutorial, the artist aims to eliminate the difficulty of learning how to drive.
